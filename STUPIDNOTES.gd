	# Momentum build up and cap, within second or less range
	# Snapped turning for player rotation
	# Variable jump height by input time
# Variable jump length influenced by momentum and surface bounce
# Input delay and early check for leaving surfaces ("coyote time" and opposite)
# Delay on high momentum turning around (momentary slide/turn.)
	# Gravity increase with fall momentum

# Walking variations (tip-toeing to running, etc.)
# Wall jumping (non-direction locked), wall sliding with input
# Temporary hovering/gliding in the air
# Ledge grabbing, moving, and gap crossing
# Jump variations (flips, side jumps, etc.)
# Standard climbing and shimmying climbing (pole shaped surfaces)
	# Ground pounding
# Swimming but done right (over and under water)
